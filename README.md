# cdm-pylint-plugin
The project is a [Codimension Python IDE](http://codimension.org) pylint plugin.

With this plugin the functionality of running pylint for a saved file is
available in the IDE.

# Installation
The plugin is pip installable:

```bash
pip install cdmpylintplugin
```

There is a little value (if any) to install it without the
[Codimension IDE](http://codimension.org).
